This game is the Day-23 project of [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Aangela Yu.

I made some tiny tweaks about the colors used in the game and the speed increament each level for a better game experience.

It took me some time to figure out how to generate all the cars and make them go and regenerate again. I am curious if there are other efficient way to write that part of code.
